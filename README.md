# Description
The repository contains a university project that aimed to visualize and draw conclusions from the data. The topic for visualization I chose was to analyze the impact of the having a common currency by West and Central African countries on selected economic factors, with a particular focus on GDP as an emanation of economic development, for the period 2015 - 2018. 26 countries belonging to ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) and ECCAS (Economic Community of Central African States) were considered. Of the countries studied, 8 have a common currency in the form of the West African CFA Franc, 6 have the Central African CFA Franc, and 12 have their own national currencies.

The repository consists of a file containing data from the World Bank in .xlsx format and an analysis file in Jupyter Notebook format.
